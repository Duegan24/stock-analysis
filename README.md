# Challenge

In this challenge our friend asked us to help him with some simple analysis on a set of stock information.

The key objectives were to do the following for a specific list of stocks:
1) Calculate the total volume traded during that year for that stock
2) Calculate the percentage return by comparing the starting and ending closing prices for that stock

The initial exercises resulted in code that was relatively inefficient, so the next step was to refactor the code to make it run more efficiently.
